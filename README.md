# Object Oriented GUI Project Using Gradle

I created this project in Fall 2020 during my Junior year of college at Florida Gulf Coast University. This project is intended to demonstrate a lot of key concepts
regarding object oriented programming, lambdas, mySQL databases, and much more. I made this project with my OOP class with professor Scott Vanselow. I 
had help from many sources and people including classmates and Teaching Assistants. Before doing this project I had a very basic understanding of the java programming
language and object oriented programming concepts. Additionally, before this project I had no experience with mySQL or databases of any kind. My professor encouraged
us to go ahead and try new things, so for the extent of this project I was 2+ weeks ahead almost the entire semester. Also, I added some optional functionality such
as a login screen. This was the most fun I have ever had programming in any class and I look forward the the assignments and projects that lie ahead. <br />

## Getting Started

• RUN THE PROGRAM<br />
• Run -> Edit Configurations -> VM configurations -> paste the text below replacing the PathToYourJavaFXSDK with the path to your JavaFX SDK. You can find this through Windows Explorer (the folder icon). (no C: and forward slashes on a Mac) <br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
--module-path "C:\PathToYourJavaFXSDK\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.base,javafx.media,javafx.graphics,javafx.swing,javafx.web<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

## Built With

* Intellij Ultimate edition 
* Scene Builder  
* W3 schools MySQL guide 


## Contributing

I wrote this project completely on my own but I had very specific direction of how to build it from my professor. Additionally, I had help from my professor, the teaching assistants, and even some classmates when I got stuck in certain spots.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

This Project taught me a substantial amount about not only programming concepts but also documentation. This is the first readme I have ever created and ther first time I've used git branches in a project. Additionally, I learned about many object oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc.. I also learned many things about MySQL and how to integrate it using java. For this project we also used concepts such as regex to compare strings, as well as lambdas and static variables. The project was mostly centered around using gradle and JavaFX to integrate it all into a GUI.
