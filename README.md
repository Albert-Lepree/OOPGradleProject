# Object Oriented GUI Project Using Gradle

I created this project in Fall 2020 during my Junior year of college at Florida Gulf Coast University. This project is intended to demonstrate a lot of key concepts
regarding object oriented programming, lambdas, mySQL databases, and much more. I made this project with my OOP class with professor Scott Vanselow. I 
had help from many sources and people including classmates and Teaching Assistants. Before doing this project I had a very basic understanding of the java programming
language and object oriented programming concepts. Additionally, before this project I had no experience with mySQL or databases of any kind. My professor encouraged
us to go ahead and try new things, so for the extent of this project I was 2+ weeks ahead almost the entire semester. Also, I added some optional functionality such
as a login screen. This was the most fun I have ever had programming in any class and I look forward the the assignments and projects that lie ahead. <br />

## Getting Started

• RUN THE PROGRAM<br />
• Run -> Edit Configurations -> VM configurations -> paste the text below replacing the PathToYourJavaFXSDK with the path to your JavaFX SDK. You can find this through Windows Explorer (the folder icon). (no C: and forward slashes on a Mac) <br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
--module-path "C:\PathToYourJavaFXSDK\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.base,javafx.media,javafx.graphics,javafx.swing,javafx.web<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

## Built With

* Intellij Ultimate edition 
* Scene Builder  
* W3 schools MySQL guide 

## Contributing

I wrote this project completely on my own but I had very specific direction of how to build it from my professor. Additionally, I had help from my professor, the teaching assistants, and even some classmates when I got stuck in certain spots.
