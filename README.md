# Object Oriented GUI Project Using Gradle

I created this project in Fall 2020 during my Junior year of college at Florida Gulf Coast University. This project is intended to demonstrate a lot of key concepts
regarding object oriented programming, lambdas, mySQL databases, and much more. I made this project with my OOP class with professor Scott Vanselow. I 
had help from many sources and people including classmates and Teaching Assistants. Before doing this project I had a very basic understanding of the java programming
language and object oriented programming concepts. Additionally, before this project I had no experience with mySQL or databases of any kind. My professor encouraged
us to go ahead and try new things, so for the extent of this project I was 2+ weeks ahead almost the entire semester. Also, I added some optional functionality such
as a login screen. This was the most fun I have ever had programming in any class and I look forward the the assignments and projects that lie ahead. <br />


## Demonstration

Add an animated gif of your program running. You can use ShareX, GIPHY Capture or another tool. https://blog.github.com/2018-06-29-GIF-that-keeps-on-GIFing/
Note for school project: This is a great way for friends and family to easily see your project in action.

## Getting Started

Instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on someone's local machine for development and testing purposes.
<br />
Note for real project: You want to be able to share your project and enable collaboration. 
<br />
Note for school project: You want a potential client or hirer to be able to run your program. 

## Built With

* IDE used  
* Other software used  
* Resources used  
<br />Note for school project: Every section is an opportunity to make an impression. You could briefly add what you know about the IDE and describe your development skills. 

## Contributing

This section is more important for real projects but is good to include in school projects. <br />
One of the main purposes of GitHub and similar services is to provide a means for project collaboration. <br />

## License

Public repositories on GitHub are often used to share open source software. For your repository to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software. https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/ <br />

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

This section would not necessarily be in a real README.  <br />
It is a reference for you and a place to impress potential employers with your knowledge. 
Identify what concepts you utilize so when you need to use them again you will know that you will find them here. Include a brief description of the concepts in your own words to help you prepare for related interview questions.
